## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

University students lack a dedicated, safe platform to collaborate academically. Existing general-purpose social networks are not focused on academic needs, have no subject-matter moderation, and don't provide AI-assisted learning tools. Students end up scattered across WhatsApp, Google Drive, and generic forums — with no unified space for peer connections, study resources, and academic discussion.

**Target users:** University students who need a moderated, AI-assisted academic collaboration platform.

### 2.2 Solution Overview

**Main features:**

- Discussion forums with category-based threads, upvotes, and AI summarization
- AI Tutor powered by Groq Llama 3.3-70B for academic assistance
- Direct messaging between students and real-time study group chat
- Study materials (upload, download, shared academic files)
- Peer connections and student discovery with search
- Event and schedule management
- AI content moderation that screens every post before it goes live
- Smart thread recommendations personalized per user

**Why this solution is appropriate:** ClassMate addresses all core requirements of Option 8 (Student Community & Collaboration Platform) — forums, chat, file sharing, event scheduling, AI moderation, and security-grade role-based access control — in a single, production-ready application.

**Where AI is used:**

1. **AI Tutor** — conversational academic assistant (Groq Llama 3.3-70B, streaming)
2. **AI Content Moderation** — every forum post and reply is screened by Groq before being saved; fail-closed (blocks on AI error)
3. **AI Thread Recommendations** — scoring algorithm surfaces relevant threads per user
